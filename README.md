# Ducks Afar v0.26.1.16

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
  <em>“This is a short experience. It will be over before you know it.”</em><br>
  &mdash; You, to yourself</blockquote>
<p>
  You are a planetary field researcher stationed far from home. The ducks in your care have wandered across a distant solar system.</p>
<p>
  To bring them back, you’ll prepare meals from sealed packs of <strong>HARDWORMS,&nbsp;</strong>highly magnetic resources that can’t be split or combined by hand. Your ducks insist on eating&nbsp;<strong>exact portions</strong>: not any more, not any less.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Ancient machines scattered across each planet are the only way to transform what you have into what you need. Learn how each mechanism changes your supply and lure each duck out, one quiet planet at a time.<br></p>
